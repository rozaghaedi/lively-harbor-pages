        I am a Research Associate at the University of Sheffield, working within the Management School on text mining and data-driven decision support systems.  
        My current work involves applying topic modeling (LDA, BERTopic) to analyze UK Modern Slavery Act statements and developing a Decision Support System using the Bestâ€“Worst Method (BWM) and Spanning Tree Enumeration (STE).  

        I hold an MSc in Computer Science (Distinction) from the Manchester Metropolitan University, where my dissertation **Deep Learning-Based Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition** was accepted for presentation at the Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2025).  

        My academic and professional experience combine machine learning, computer vision, and software development.  
        I am passionate about interdisciplinary applications bridging technology and societal impact.

        ðŸ“¬ I am open to opportunities in Data Science and Deep Learning Research roles where I can contribute to impactful, data-driven projects.

        My research focuses on developing robust and interpretable machine learning systems across visual, textual, and multimodal data domains.  
        I am particularly interested in:
        - Cross-domain facial expression recognition and emotion understanding  
        - Text mining and topic modeling for social impact (e.g., modern slavery analysis)  

        Recent publication highlights:
        - _Graph-Attention Network with Adversarial Domain Alignment for Robust Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition_, ACML 2025  
        - _Markov-Based Reliability Assessment for Distribution Systems Considering Failure Rates_, IEEE Access (2023)
